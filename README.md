**ðŸ“„ CV-Parsing-Pipeline**
***ðŸ§  Overview****
CV-Parsing-Pipeline is an end-to-end automation pipeline that:

Converts CVs (PDFs) into plain text.

Extracts structured candidate information (skills, education, work experience, projects) using a language model.

Generates vector embeddings for these extracted fields.

Stores the vectorized data in a vector database (e.g. Qdrant) for fast, scalable search and retrieval.

This pipeline simplifies CV screening, enhances querying by semantic similarity, and is easy to integrate into existing recruitment tools.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… PDF to text conversion â€” extract raw text content with minimal dependencies.

âœ… LLM-powered parsing â€” structured extraction with a custom schema.

âœ… Field-specific vector embeddings â€” represent skills, experience, etc. numerically.

âœ… Efficient vector database operations â€” upsert and search vectors using Qdrant.

âœ… Error handling & logging â€” gracefully skip failed CVs.

âœ… Extensible and modular â€” easy to add new extractors or vector stores.

ðŸ§  Parsing Details
The pipeline uses a language model (parsing_helper.py) to parse CVs into a strict JSON schema:
{
  "skills": ["Python", "NLP", "Machine Learning"],
  "work_experience": "Explicit work history as a string",
  "education": "Degree, major, years as a string",
  "projects": ["Project1 title or description"]
}
Missing fields return null or empty lists as appropriate.

ðŸ“Š Vector Storage
vector_embed.py encodes each field into a fixed-length vector.

vector_store.py handles Qdrant upserts and searches.

Weights for different fields can be tuned in get_user_requirements() or similar utility.
